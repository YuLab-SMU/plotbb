# plotbb: Grammar of Graphics for base plot


<!-- README.md is generated from README.qmd. Please edit that file -->

A grammar of graphics framework built on ‘base’ graphics. It provides a
‘bbplot’ object and a ‘+’ operator to incrementally compose plots from
data, aesthetic mappings and layers, then render them using the base
plotting system. The package includes common geometric layers (points,
lines, segments, bars, histograms, boxplots and tiles), scales for color
and other aesthetics, legends, faceting, themes, and significance
annotations.
