# plotbb: Grammar of Graphics for base plot


<!-- README.md is generated from README.qmd. Please edit that file -->

For many times, we are not just aligning plots as what ‘cowplot’ and
‘patchwork’ did. Users would like to align associated information that
requires axes to be exactly matched in subplots, e.g. hierarchical
clustering with a heatmap. Inspired by the ‘Method 2’ in ‘ggtree’ (G Yu
(2018) <doi:10.1093/molbev/msy194>), ‘aplot’ provides utilities to
aligns associated subplots to a main plot at different sides (left,
right, top and bottom) with axes exactly matched.
