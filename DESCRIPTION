Description: A grammar of graphics framework built on 'base' graphics. It
  provides a 'bbplot' object and a '+' operator to incrementally compose plots
  from data, aesthetic mappings and layers, then render them using the base
  plotting system. The package includes common geometric layers (points, lines,
  segments, bars, histograms, boxplots and tiles), scales for color and other
  aesthetics, legends, faceting, themes, and significance annotations.
